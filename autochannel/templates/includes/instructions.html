        <h3>
            What to do after I added the bot to my server?
        </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Either click "dashboard" or click your server icon in the navbar</li>
            <li>In the server category dashboard you can make your desired changes</li>
            <li>Options you can modify:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Enabled: Enables the autochannel to create channels in
                        this category
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Prefix: This sets the prefix of each channel created in
                        your designated category. Must be unique prefix in that
                        category. This is important as this tells the bot if the
                        channel is managed by it or a static channel on the
                        server. (default AC!)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Channel size: This sets the size of the channel, which
                        is the number of users who can connect to the
                        autocreated channels. (deault 10)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Empty count: This sets the number of empty channels the
                        category should always have. Recommended is the default
                        of 1, but for larger communities having up to 10 empty
                        channels will make this easier to find spare rooms.
                        (default 1)
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                For each item updated, please press the check mark next to each
                entry to make sure it is saved. When successfull you will see a
                green notification with the updated changes
            </li>
            <li>
                Final step as an admin in your server you just run "!acupdate"
                for AutoChannel update and will sync the bot with the configurations
                you just set
