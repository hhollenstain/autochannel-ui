                What is AutoChannel?
            </h4>
            <p>
                AutoChannel is here for Admins/moderators/channel managers to
                facilitate managing voice channels. This can help you moderate
                small to large discord servers with over 1 million+ active users.
            </p>
            <p>
                Auto-chan (AutoChannels friendly bot!) does this by watching
                categories you specified to always have empty channels. You can
                tell Auto-chan to watch specific categories and always make sure
                it has 1-10 empty channels and you can set how many users can be
                in each channel generated.  You might think but how does this
                make my life easier? This means you will no longer have excess
                channels and not have to scroll endless looking for groups or
                see how many rooms are occupied.
            </p>
            <p>
                Auto-chan also checks to make sure you don't have too many
                channels in your categories. If people leave it will
                automatically clean up empty channels.
